No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.\n\n\n\nCommunity Impact: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.\nConsequence: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.\n\n\n\nCommunity Impact: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.\nConsequence: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.\n\n\n\n\nThis Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 2.1, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.html.\nCommunity Impact Guidelines were inspired by Mozilla’s code of conduct enforcement ladder.\nFor answers to common questions about this code of conduct, see the FAQ at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/faq.
